# Real-Time-Bangla-Sign-Langugae-detection-with-text-and-speech-recognition



THis is my most recent work i have done, I am doing thesis on this topic and collect more then 120 thousand data of others and mines too and annotate and labelling them for getting a realistick accuracy . I used Machine learning model for static classification of bangla sign then deep learning model for real time recongtion and then use que , short breaker for confirmation of the sign then translate detected sign as string and then pass the string to the offline text to speech tts enginee to speak up beside i use  bangla font to handle bangal text
